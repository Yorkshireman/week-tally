## FAQs

### How do I completely reset the app and start again?

Go to Settings and tap **Reset the app**. Bear in mind this is non-reversible and will delete absolutely all of the data you have logged so far. You may wish to instead delete Things (Settings > Things tracked > tap the 3-dots icon) or toggle some Things off.

### How do I change my daily notification time?

In Settings, tap **Daily Notification Time** and follow the instructions.
